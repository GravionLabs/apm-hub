Analyze this codebase to generate a new `AGENTS.md` file in project root for guiding AI coding agents.

Focus on discovering the essential knowledge that would help AI agents be immediately productive in this codebase. Consider aspects like:

* The "big picture" architecture that requires reading multiple files to understand — major components, service boundaries, data flows, and the "why" behind structural decisions
* Critical developer workflows (builds, tests, debugging) — especially commands that aren't obvious from file inspection alone
* Project-specific conventions and patterns that differ from common practices
* Integration points, external dependencies, and cross-component communication patterns

Source existing AI conventions from `**/{.github/copilot-instructions.md,AGENT.md,AGENTS.md,CLAUDE.md,.cursorrules,.windsurfrules,.clinerules,.cursor/rules/**,.windsurf/rules/**,.clinerules/**,README.md}` (do one glob search).

Guidelines (see https://agents.md/):

* Write concise, actionable instructions (~20-50 lines) using markdown structure
* Include specific examples from the codebase when describing patterns
* Avoid generic advice ("write tests", "handle errors") — focus on THIS project's specific approaches
* Document only discoverable patterns, not aspirational practices
* Reference key files/directories that exemplify important patterns

Generate `AGENTS.md` first. After creating it, summarize what was included so the user is aware of the content.
